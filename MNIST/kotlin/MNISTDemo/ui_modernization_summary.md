# Material Design 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement Material Design 3 (Material You) in the MNIST Demo application. The implementation includes a custom color system with light/dark theme support, dynamic theming based on platform capabilities, a consistent typography scale, and an elevation and shadow system for depth.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- Added Material Design 3 dependency to the build.gradle.kts file
- Kept Material Design 2 dependency for backward compatibility during migration

### 2. Theme Components
Created a comprehensive theme package with the following components:

#### Color System
- Implemented a complete Material Design 3 color system in `Color.kt`
- Created light and dark color schemes with semantic color naming
- Defined all required colors for surfaces, containers, and content

#### Typography Scale
- Implemented a complete Material Design 3 typography scale in `Typography.kt`
- Defined text styles for display, headline, title, body, and label text
- Set appropriate font weights, sizes, line heights, and letter spacing

#### Shape System
- Implemented a Material Design 3 shape system in `Shape.kt`
- Defined corner radii for different component sizes
- Created a consistent shape language across the application

#### Theme Composable
- Created a central `AppTheme` composable in `Theme.kt`
- Implemented support for light/dark themes
- Added dynamic theming capabilities based on platform support
- Created a convenience `AppSurface` composable for consistent surface styling

### 3. Platform-Specific Implementations
- Android: Implemented dynamic color support for Android 12+ devices
- Desktop: Added fallback to predefined color schemes
- WebAssembly: Added fallback to predefined color schemes

### 4. UI Component Updates
- Updated App.kt to use the new AppTheme and AppSurface
- Updated SimpleApp.kt to use Material Design 3 components
- Updated DrawingScreen.kt to use Material Design 3 components:
  - Changed Button and Text components to Material Design 3 versions
  - Updated typography references (body1 → bodyLarge, h5 → headlineMedium)
  - Updated button color parameters (backgroundColor → containerColor)

## Benefits

### Improved Visual Design
- Modern, cohesive visual language following Material Design 3 guidelines
- Better visual hierarchy through consistent typography and color usage
- Enhanced depth perception through the elevation system

### Better User Experience
- Light and dark theme support for different lighting conditions
- Dynamic theming on supported platforms for personalized user experience
- Consistent UI components across the application

### Future-Proofing
- Alignment with Google's latest design system
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Platform-specific optimizations while maintaining cross-platform compatibility

## Documentation
Detailed documentation on how to use the Material Design 3 components is available in the `README.md` file in the theme package.
