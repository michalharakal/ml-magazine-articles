# MNIST Demo App Changes

## Issues Addressed

1. **Icon Buttons Replacement**: Replaced emoji-based icon buttons with text buttons for better clarity and accessibility.
2. **Model Loading Fix**: Fixed a bug where the model had to be loaded every time the drawing screen was entered.

## Changes Made

### 1. Icon Buttons Replacement

The app was using emoji characters as icons in buttons, which could be unclear and might not display properly on all platforms. I replaced these with text buttons that clearly indicate their function:

- Changed "‚úì" or "üñºÔ∏è" to "Select" or "Images"
- Changed "‚¨áÔ∏è" to "Load Model"
- Changed "‚úì" (for classification) to "Classify"
- Changed "üóëÔ∏è" to "Clear"

This makes the app more accessible and the button functions more obvious to users.

### 2. Model Loading Fix

The app was creating a new DigitClassifier instance every time the DrawingScreen was displayed, causing the model to be reloaded each time. This was inefficient and led to a poor user experience. I implemented the following changes to fix this:

1. **Created a DigitClassifierSingleton**: This singleton ensures that only one instance of the DigitClassifier is created and the model is loaded only once.

2. **Modified DrawingScreenViewModel**: Updated the ViewModel to use the singleton instead of creating its own DigitClassifier instance.

3. **Added Automatic Model Loading**: Added a LaunchedEffect in the DrawingScreen composable to automatically load the model when the screen is first displayed.

4. **Added State Observation**: Implemented a mechanism in the ViewModel to observe changes to the model loading state from the singleton.

## Implementation Details

### DigitClassifierSingleton

This singleton manages a single instance of the DigitClassifier and tracks whether the model is loaded. It provides methods to:
- Get or create the classifier instance
- Load the model if needed
- Classify images

### DrawingScreenViewModel Changes

The ViewModel now:
- Uses the DigitClassifierSingleton instead of creating its own DigitClassifier
- Observes the model loading state from the singleton
- Delegates model loading and classification to the singleton

### DrawingScreen Changes

The DrawingScreen composable now:
- Automatically loads the model when the screen is first displayed
- Uses text buttons instead of emoji-based icon buttons

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: The model is loaded only once, eliminating the need to reload it every time the user navigates to the drawing screen.
2. **Better Accessibility**: Text buttons clearly indicate their function, making the app more accessible.
3. **Reduced Resource Usage**: Loading the model only once reduces memory and CPU usage.
4. **Clearer Code**: The singleton pattern makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Future Improvements

1. **Use StateFlow for Reactive Updates**: Replace the polling mechanism with a more reactive approach using StateFlow or similar.
2. **Add Loading Progress Indicator**: Show a progress indicator during model loading.
3. **Implement Error Handling**: Add better error handling for model loading failures.
4. **Add Button Icons**: Consider adding proper vector icons alongside text for better visual cues.
