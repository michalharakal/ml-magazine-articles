# Icons in Web App Fix

## Issue
Icons were missing in the web (WASM) version of the app. The app was using emoji characters as icons, which might not be properly supported in all web browsers.

## Solution
The solution was to add proper font support for emoji characters in the web app. This was done by:

1. Adding the Noto Color Emoji font from Google Fonts
2. Creating a CSS class specifically for emoji characters
3. Adding a JavaScript script to apply the CSS class to elements containing emoji characters

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated styles.css
- Added import for Noto Color Emoji font from Google Fonts
- Added font-family to html and body elements to include Noto Color Emoji
- Added a CSS class `.emoji` specifically for emoji characters

### 2. Updated index.html
- Added preconnect links for Google Fonts to improve loading performance
- Added script tag for emoji-support.js

### 3. Created emoji-support.js
- Created a script that finds all text nodes containing emoji characters
- Wraps those text nodes in a span with the `.emoji` class
- Uses a MutationObserver to apply the same logic to new elements

## How It Works
When the web app loads, the emoji-support.js script scans the DOM for text nodes containing emoji characters. When it finds one, it wraps it in a span with the `.emoji` class, which applies the Noto Color Emoji font to that element. This ensures that the emoji characters are properly displayed in the web app.

The script also sets up a MutationObserver to apply the same logic to new elements that are added to the DOM, ensuring that emoji characters added after the initial load are also properly displayed.

## Testing
The solution has been tested by building the web version of the app. The build completed successfully, which means that our changes have been integrated into the project without causing any compilation errors.

To verify that the icons are now displaying correctly, you should run the web app and check that the following emoji characters are properly displayed:
- "‚úì" (check mark)
- "üñºÔ∏è" (picture frame)
- "‚¨áÔ∏è" (down arrow)
- "üóëÔ∏è" (trash can)

## Future Improvements
For a more robust solution, you might consider:
1. Using actual icon fonts like Material Icons or Font Awesome
2. Using SVG icons instead of emoji characters
3. Creating a custom icon component that handles platform-specific rendering
