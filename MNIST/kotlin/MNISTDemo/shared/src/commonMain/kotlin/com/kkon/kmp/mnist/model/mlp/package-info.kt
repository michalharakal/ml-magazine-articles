/**
 * This package contains Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implementations for MNIST digit classification.
 * 
 * MLPs are a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consist of at least three layers:
 * an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. They are simpler than CNNs but can still
 * achieve good performance on the MNIST digit classification task.
