/**
 * This package contains Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementations for MNIST digit classification.
 * 
 * CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks like MNIST digit recognition
 * because they can automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input images.
