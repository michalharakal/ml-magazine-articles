# Layout Improvements in MNIST Demo App

## Issues Addressed

1. **Content Blocks Jumping Around**: When a recognized digit was displayed, the layout would shift, causing a jarring user experience.
2. **Redundant Instructions**: Instructions were shown on the drawing page, even though they belong in the home section.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Content Jumping

The issue was caused by the way the classification result was displayed. When a digit was recognized, a new element would appear in the layout, pushing other content down. When the result was cleared, the content would jump back up.

**Solution**: Added a fixed-height container for the classification result. This container is always present in the layout, even when there's no result to display. This ensures that the layout remains stable regardless of whether a result is being shown.

```kotlin
// Result display with fixed height to prevent layout jumps
Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .height(80.dp)  // Fixed height container
        .fillMaxWidth(),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
    // Only show the card when there's a result
    if (classificationResult != null) {
        Card(
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth(0.8f),
            elevation = CardDefaults.cardElevation(defaultElevation = 4.dp),
            colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(
                containerColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceVariant
            )
        ) {
            Text(
                text = classificationResult,
                style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium,
                modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Removed Redundant Instructions

The drawing screen had an instruction card at the top that explained how to use the drawing feature. This was redundant with the information already provided in the home screen.

**Solution**: Removed the instruction card from the drawing screen. The home screen already provides sufficient information about how to use the app, and removing the redundant instructions makes the drawing screen cleaner and more focused.

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: The layout no longer jumps around when a digit is recognized, providing a smoother and more professional user experience.
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Removing redundant instructions makes the drawing screen cleaner and more focused on its primary purpose.
3. **Better Information Architecture**: Instructions are now only shown in the home section, where they belong, making the app's information architecture more logical and consistent.

## Future Improvements

1. **Contextual Help**: Consider adding a small help icon on the drawing screen that, when clicked, shows a tooltip with instructions. This would provide help when needed without cluttering the interface.
2. **Animated Transitions**: Add smooth animations when showing/hiding the classification result to make the experience even more polished.
